### Google Calendar

**Strength**<br>

1. Able to create subtasks for each task and write details for each task/subtask
2. Able to create multiple lists to group related tasks together
3. Has a calendar view that allows user to view events, deadlines and tasks by day, week or month

**Weakness**<br>

1. Only able to view one list at a time, unable to view all tasks at once
2. Task GUI is narrow and feels a bit cluttered when there are many tasks in the list

```
###### \UserGuide.md

> **Task Structure**<br>

> There are 3 types of tasks.
> * To-do
> * Deadline

> Every task is either a to-do, deadline or event. It cannot be both or all 3 or none at all.<br>
> Refer to [Glossary](DeveloperGuide.md#appendix-d--glossary) for definitions of each type of task.
